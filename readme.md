# NeighboLine

## About
This website is home to NeighborLine, an in-process project by Simone Salvo, Dawn Sinkowski, and Terrel Ibanez for the ITP/IMPA Covid-19 Hackathon.

Neighborline is an application using the Twilio API that pairs incoming callers together for a friendly chat. Using the lowest common denominator of a phone call, Neighborlineaims to bridge low-fi communications with a high-fi world.

This website was made to explain the project and act as an interface for spreading the word; aggregating relevant resources; and showcasing documentation for others to replicate in their local communities.

## Concept note
My original proposal was to build off of my first week's website, an online presence for my grandmother, who is not on the internet.

In the new reality of Covid-19, people like my grandmoth, who don't have a vibrant online social life and rely on phone calls, in-person visits, and snail-mail for connection, are even further isolated.

This [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/nyregion/coronavirus-elderly-nyc.html?te=1&nl=new-york%20today&emc=edit_ur_20200322&campaign_id=44&instance_id=16972&segment_id=22541&user_id=69569e11c12b319f7111f09dee593586&regi_id=8483880220200322) from the New York Times explains well the lonliness that the elderly, and those without access to the interne, are experiencing in this moment.

When I saw the note about the hackathon, I connected with Dawn, who proposed the initaial concept of NeighborLine and decided to dedicate this time to building out a tool that would have resonsence beyond this final assignment.

## Built with

1. VS Code
2. Mongo DB
3. Node js
4. GitHub
5. Glitch
6. Twilio + AWS (for phone application)

## Functionality

There's still be work to be done. Currently, the wbesite has a resource section. These individual pages need to be built out to include relevant links and information.

At the bottome, there's a feedback form for users to post comments. The data is registering in the database and displaying on the front-end, however the styling is not yet resolved.
